## YOUNGJUN KIM
# About me

I'm a third year Ph.D. Candidate in Quant Marketing Lab at KAIST School of Business and Technology Management. My research interest is the application of Machine Learning or Deep Learning to solve business problems or find insights.

My dream is to bring happiness to as many people as possible. I have pursued this goal throughout my life, from majoring in violin in Austria during middle school to seeking opportunities in Australia during high school. Upon returning to Korea, I continued my efforts.
A turning point came when I read “Banker to the Poor,” a book about Muhammad Yunus, the founder of the Grameen Bank. Yunus pioneered microfinance, providing loans to the poor and proving that financial services could empower the impoverished without incurring losses. This inspired me to believe that innovation could enhance happiness on a large scale.
Today, I aim to achieve this through data-related research, convinced that data-driven insights can drive transformative innovations to improve lives globally.
